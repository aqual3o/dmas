# dmas

dmas is a Nodejs module that lets you do basic maths operations.

These operation are natively avaialble in any language. You don't really need this one (this was more of a practice module).

Might turn into something useful one day.

## Installation

Use the node package manager (npm) to install dmas

```bash
npm i dmas
```

## Usage

```
const dmas = require ("dmas");

let sum      = dmas.sum      (2, 4);
let multiply = dmas.multiply (2, 4);
let divide   = dmas.divide   (4, 2);
let subtract = dmas.subtract (4, 2);
```
